# Section 2: SOLID Design Principles

- [x] 3. Overview
- [x] 4. Single Responsibility Principle

  - Class should only have a single responsibility
  - Should only have one reason to change related to that responsibility
  - Antipattern: the god object
  - Seperation of concerns

- [x] 4. Open-Closed Principle

  - Objects are open for extension (e.g, inheritance), but close for modification (e.g, adding methods, etc)
  - Instead, use specification pattern & combinator pattern
